IDM classic full of interesting beats, breaks and synth work. Not given enough credit elsewhere.
02: Damon Albarn - The Nearer The Fountain, More Pure The Stream Flows (2021) - For fans of Radiohead, Elbow and Nick Cave. A soft introspective ambient pop LP from one of the best songwriters of his time.
03: HEALTH - DEATH MAGIC (2015) - For fans of Death Grips, Crystal Castles and Black Dresses.</description><content>&lt;p>01: µ-Ziq - Lunatic Harness (1997) For fans of Aphex Twin, Boards of Canada and Autechre.

&lt;p>02: Damon Albarn - The Nearer The Fountain, More Pure The Stream Flows (2021) - For fans of Radiohead, Elbow and Nick Cave. A soft introspective ambient pop LP from one of the best songwriters of his time.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>03: HEALTH - DEATH MAGIC (2015) - For fans of Death Grips, Crystal Castles and Black Dresses. Synth Punk LP full to the brim of heavy industrial noise from the California trio.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>04: BADBADNOTGOOD - IV (2019) - For fans of Flying Lotus, Alfa Mist and The Comet is Coming. Nu Jazz fusion LP full of catchy hip hop infused tracks with some incredible featuring artists including KAYTRANADA, Mick Jenkins and Robert Glasper.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>05: Bon Iver - i,i (2019) - For fans of James Blake, Angel Olsen and Frank Ocean. An atmospheric experimental effort from Justin Vernon and co, pushing the boundaries of the pop synth genre. Seriously underrated.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>06: Sons of Kemet - Your Queen is a Reptile (2018) For fans of. A Nu Jazz LP full of rhythm and energy with some serious political undertones led by Saxophonist-in-chief Shabaka Hutchings.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>07: The War On Drugs - I Don&amp;rsquo;t Live Here Anymore (2021) - For fans of Kurt Vile, Destroyer and Kevin Morby. Soft indie rock record from the Philly six-piece. A dreamy introspective LP that serves well for a background play but allows space for a deeper experience.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Personal highlight - BADBADNOTGOOD. I haven&amp;rsquo;t been able to stop listening to this album. Front to back full of seriously good tunes. Can&amp;rsquo;t fault it in anyway.&lt;/p></content></item><item><title>Soundcloud</title><link>https://fattango.github.io/music/soundcloud/</link><pubDate>Wed, 05 Jan 2022 21:32:03 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://fattango.github.io/music/soundcloud/</guid><description>https://soundcloud.com/fat-tango</description><content>&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://soundcloud.com/fat-tango">https://soundcloud.com/fat-tango&lt;/a>&lt;/p></content></item><item><title>Instagram</title><link>https://fattango.github.io/music/instagram/</link><pubDate>Sun, 02 Jan 2022 21:32:03 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://fattango.github.io/music/instagram/</guid><description/><content/></item></channel></rss>
